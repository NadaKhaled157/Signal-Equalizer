# Signal-Equalizer
This project develops a desktop application that functions as a **signal equaliser**. The application allows users to **manipulate the magnitude of frequency components** in a signal and reconstruct the modified signal. 

## Equalizer Modes

*   **Uniform Range Mode:** Divides the frequency range into 10 equal sections, each controlled by a slider.
*   **Musical Instruments Mode:**  Adjusts the magnitude of specific musical instruments in a mixed signal containing four instruments.
*   **Animal Sounds Mode:** Controls the magnitude of specific animal sounds in a mixed signal of four animal sounds.
*   **Mixed Music and Animals Mode:**  A mix between the animal and music modes. User can adjust the presence of different animals and musical instruments in the audio.

*   **Weiner Filter Mode:** Removes noise from a sound.

## Features

*   Sliders for adjusting frequency magnitudes of signal components.
*   Two linked cine signal viewers to display the input and output signals synchronously, with functionality for playback control, zoom, pan, and reset. 
*   Two spectrograms (one for input and one for output) that visually represent the frequency content of the signals. Spectrograms can be toggled on/off.
*   The ability to display the frequency range in either linear scale or Audiogram scale.
